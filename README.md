# song-rec.me

**Your non-algorithmic way of getting Spotify recommendations**  
_(Or at least, that was the idea.)_

## ⚠️ Important Note

As of May 2025, Spotify’s API changes make it impossible for an app like this to be publicly accessible.

## What is it?

**song-rec.me** was built around a simple but personal concept:

1. A Spotify user logs in and creates a playlist.
2. The app generates a **shareable link** tied to that playlist.
3. Friends can visit the link, search for songs, and "send" a recommendation.
4. When a recommendation is submitted:
   - The selected song is added to the user’s playlist.
   - The user receives an **email notification**.
   - The recommendation appears on their dashboard at song-rec.me.

## Isn’t This Just a Collaborative Playlist?

Not quite:

- **Collaborative playlists** are visible to all contributors and, if public, to anyone.
- There's **no privacy** between the sender and the playlist owner.
- Spotify does **not notify** you when a song is added.

With **song-rec.me**, the experience is:

- **Private** — only the playlist owner sees the recommendations.
- **One-to-one** — it's between the sender and the recipient only.
- **Notified** — the owner gets an email every time a new song is sent.

## Reflection

Although this website ultimately failed, I still believe it would be a great feature for Spotify to add—a profile-based playlist where others (perhaps only friends) can add songs, and the owner gets notified. This would definitely bring users back to the app and increase retention.
